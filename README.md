## Covid 19 Data Exploration

### Introduction
This contains SQL queries and data exploration scripts for analyzing Covid-19 data, including death rates, vaccination statistics, infection rates, and population statistics.

### Data Source
The data used for this analysis is sourced from the "Covid Death & Vaccination" dataset.

### Queries Overview
#### Exploration Queries
 **Select all Covid death and vaccination data with continents:** Retrieves all data from the "Covid Deaths" table where the continent is not null, ordered by columns 3 and 4.
 **Select relevant data for exploration:** Selects specific columns for exploration from the "Covid Deaths" table where the continent is not null, ordered by location and date.

#### Country-wise Analysis
**Total cases vs Total deaths:** Calculates the death percentage based on total cases for each country.
**Total cases vs Population:** Calculates the percentage of the population infected with Covid-19 for each country.
**Countries with highest infection rate compared to population:** Identifies countries with the highest infection rates compared to their populations.
**Country with highest death count:** Identifies the country with the highest death count.
**Country with highest death count for total population:** Identifies the country with the highest death count relative to its total population.

#### Continent-wise Analysis
**Continent with highest death count:** Identifies the continent with the highest death count.

#### Worldwide Data
**Worldwide Covid-19 data:** Provides a summary of worldwide Covid-19 cases and deaths.

#### Data Joins and Transformations
**Joining Covid death and vaccination tables:** Joins the Covid death and vaccination tables based on location, date, and continent.
**New data for analysis by joining tables:** Retrieves new data for analysis by joining the Covid death and vaccination tables.
**Showing people vaccinated vs country on date basis:** Shows the number of people vaccinated per country on a specific date.

#### Using CTEs and Temporary Tables
**Using CTE for people vaccinated percentage:** Calculates the percentage of people vaccinated using a Common Table Expression (CTE).
**Temporary table for calculation of people vaccinated percentage:** Creates a temporary table to calculate the percentage of people vaccinated.

#### Views for Visualization
**DeathTableStats View:** A view containing death statistics for visualization purposes.
**PopulationVsVaccination View:** A view containing population and vaccination statistics for visualization.

### Visualization Data Queries
**Total cases, total deaths, and death percentage:** Retrieves total cases, total deaths, and death percentage.
**Total death count by location:** Retrieves the total death count by location.
**Highest infection count and percentage:** Retrieves the highest infection count and percentage for each location.
**Highest infection count and percentage by date:** Retrieves the highest infection count and percentage for each location by date.
